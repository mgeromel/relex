Wright  COMMA  a  University of Texas  law  professor  COMMA  served  as  one  of  Nixon  's  lawyers  in  1973  and  1974  while  the  Watergate  special  prosecutor  was  trying  to  subpoena  the  White House  tapes  .

An  enraged  Nikita Khrushchev  instructed  Soviet  ships  to  ignore  President  Kennedy  's  naval  blockade  during  the  Cuban missile crisis  COMMA  but  the  order  was  reversed  just  hours  before  an  inevitable  confrontation  COMMA  according  to  a  new  book  .
James G. Blight  and  David A. Welch  of  Harvard University  's  John F. Kennedy School of Government  say  that  `  `  if  this  order  had  held  COMMA  war  between  the  superpowers  would  probably  have  commenced  at  sea  COMMA  shortly  after  10 o 'clock  on  Wednesday  morning  COMMA  Oct. 24 COMMA 1962  COMMA  several  hundred  miles  off  the  coast  of  Cuba.

Anastas Mikoyan  COMMA  then  Soviet  first  deputy  premier  COMMA  was  the  catalyst  for  the  reversal  of  Khrushchev  's  order  COMMA  according  to  the  authors  .
Mikoyan  `  `  preempted  Khrushchev  's  order  to  run  the  blockade  and  ordered  Soviet  ships  to  stop  just  short  of  the  quarantine  line  COMMA  '  '  they  say  .
The  book  COMMA  `  `  On the Brink : Americans and Soviets Reexamine the Cuban Missile Crisis  COMMA  '  '  is  based  largely  on  two  1987  conferences  sponsored  by  Harvard  _  one  that  featured  top  Kennedy  advisers  and  U.S.  scholars  and  a  second  in  which  three  Soviets  joined  the  Americans  .
The  book  said  Khrushchev  's  order  to  ignore  the  blockade  was  disclosed  in  a  largely  unknown  work  by  dissident  Soviet  historian  Roy Medvedev  .
Their  theory  that  the  warheads  were  blocked  by  the  quarantine  is  at  odds  with  a  recent  disclosure  by  Aleksander Alekseev  COMMA  the  former  ambassador  to  Cuba  COMMA  who  said  in  a  recent  Soviet  magazine  that  42  medium-range  missiles  were  fully  operational  .

`  `  We  think  this  is  not  a  very  likely  scenario  COMMA  but  it  's  a  check  that  can  be  done  very  COMMA  very  quickly  without  disrupting  service  COMMA  '  '  said  Federal Aviation Administration  spokesman  John Leyden  .
FAA  Administrator  Allan McArtor  issued  the  order  after  the  British Civil Aviation Authority  ordered  similar  checks  for  three  types  of  aircraft  flown  by  British  carriers  COMMA  including  the  same  two  models  of  the  737  and  the  Airbus  A320  .

Another  GE  employee  COMMA  attorney  Robert C. Anderson  COMMA  said  in  a  letter  last  year  that  test  records  may  have  been  falsified  for  valves  used  on  the  FA-18  in  1984-87  .
The  timer  valve  manufactured  by  GE  for  the  CFM56  engine  on  the  737  could  not  have  caused  the  turbine  to  fail  or  threatened  flight  safety  even  if  the  valve  malfunctioned  COMMA  Kennedy  said  in  telephone  interview  from  his  office  in  Cincinnati  COMMA  where  GE  's  aircraft  engine  operations  are  based  .

In  Washington  COMMA  U.S.  strategists  upgraded  the  missile  threat  from  Pyongyang  from  potential  to  real  and  decided  that  the  communist  country  required  high-level  attention  .
Yisrael Tal  COMMA  one  of  the  top  military  strategists  in  Israel  COMMA  says  the  Arabs  have  reached  a  strategic  balance  with  Israel  through  their  acquisition  of  ground-to-ground  missiles  .
Tal  COMMA  a  senior  Defense Ministry  official  COMMA  has  not  repeated  these  views  in  public  .
"  I  was  hearing  the  same  story  COMMA  "  says  James Hackett  COMMA  an  executive  with  Titan Systems  and  one  of  the  leading  missile  experts  in  the  U.S .
"  The  entire  effort  is  how  to  reduce  the  early  damage  -LRB-  from  a  missile  attack  -RRB-  so  the  missile  launchers  can  be  found  COMMA  "  says  Me 'ir Kohen  COMMA  a  missile  expert  close  to  the  IDF  -LRB-  Israel Defense Forces  -RRB-  leadership  .
"  It  -LRB-  Arrow  -RRB-  is  not  practical  in  the  short  term  COMMA  "  says  former  Air Force  commander  Avihu Bin-Nun  .
"  For  the  IDF  COMMA  it  makes  sense  not  to  put  all  of  its  money  into  one  thing  it  can  't  back  out  of  COMMA  "  says  Ze 'ev Eytan  COMMA  a  senior  researcher  and  an  editor  of  the  annual  military  survey  released  by  the  Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies  .

As  Michael Holtcamp  COMMA  the  manager  of  the  project  COMMA  based  in  Huntsville  COMMA  Alabama  COMMA  put  it  COMMA  one  slip  of  the  Arrow  's  sensor  or  radar  and  the  mission  is  unsuccessful  .
Gerald Steinberg  COMMA  an  expert  on  missiles  at  Bar-Ilan University  COMMA  agrees  that  the  problem  is  daunting  .
"  IAI  engineers  are  trying  to  enter  completely  new  fields  where  unknowns  dominate  COMMA  "  says  Reuven Pedatzur  COMMA  a  defense  researcher  who  last  month  released  a  report  on  the  Arrow  for  the  Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies  .
Aharon Levran  COMMA  who  has  researched  the  Arrow  for  Bar-Ilan University  's  Center for Strategic Studies  COMMA  calls  Pedatzur  's  estimate  baseless  and  misleading  .
In  Washington  COMMA  the  General Accounting Office  -LRB-  GAO  -RRB-  COMMA  the  congressional  watchdog  of  government  spending  COMMA  says  in  a  report  released  last  August  that  Israel  might  be  underestimating  the  costs  of  producing  and  deploying  the  Arrow  system  .
"  This  is  the  great  lurking  problem  in  all  technology  transfers  COMMA  "  says  Steven Bryen  COMMA  a  former  Pentagon  official  responsible  for  U.S.  technology  transfers  .
"  What  's  my  goal  ?  "  asks  Pedatzur  COMMA  who  now  works  for  the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology  .
A  tough-talking  former  Associated Press  reporter  now  representing  IAI  in  Washington  COMMA  Klemow  protects  the  Arrow  as  if  it  were  his  own  child  .
Malcolm O 'Neill  COMMA  the  head  of  the  Ballistic Missile Development Organization  COMMA  the  U.S.  agency  involved  in  the  Arrow  COMMA  told  Congress  last  May  that  Israel  is  committed  to  completing  the  development  of  the  Arrow  COMMA  regardless  of  U.S.  aid  .
"  His  position  is  very  supportive  -LRB-  of  the  Arrow  -RRB-  COMMA  "  says  Oded Ben-Ami  COMMA  Rabin  's  spokesman  at  the  Defense Ministry  .
"  U.S.  decision-makers  should  understand  that  the  signals  they  send  today  will  have  major  ramifications  for  the  Israeli  approach  to  the  Arrow  program  COMMA  "  says  Marvin Feuerwerger  in  a  1991  study  for  the  Washington Institute for Near East Policy  .

The  Australian Government  has  considered  inviting  a  senior  North Korean Government  official  to  visit  Australia  later  in  the  year  to  initiate  a  stronger  dialogue  between  the  two  countries  .
This  greatly  eases  the  government  's  policy  that  was  decided  upon  at  the  August  reunification-related  ministers  meeting  in  which  it  decided  that  `  businessmen  will  be  allowed  to  visit  North Korea  only  when  North Korea  completely  returns  to  the  Nuclear  Nonproliferation  Treaty  and  agrees  to  the  inspection  of  unreported  facilities  in  Yongbyon.

-LRB-  Text  -RRB-  Beijing  COMMA  23 Jun  -LRB-  XINHUA  -RRB-  --  Briefing  the  National People 's Congress  -LRB-  NPC  -RRB-  on  "  China  's  21st  Century  Agenda  "  today  COMMA  Vice  of  the  State Science and Technology Commission  Deng Nan  called  for  the  final  solution  of  environmental  problems  COMMA  adding  that  the  economy  must  develop  on  a  long-term  basis  COMMA  but  if  environmental  problems  are  ignored  in  the  process  of  development  COMMA  economic  development  will  be  seriously  hampered  .
This  volume  of  policy  guidance  documents  COMMA  compiled  like  an  encyclopedia  and  approved  by  the  Chinese Government  COMMA  expounds  the  strategy  for  sustained  development  in  China  and  will  certainly  serve  as  guidance  for  drawing  up  long-  and  medium-range  economic  and  social  development  plans  for  China  .
Deng Nan  said  :  China  has  entered  a  stage  in  which  its  economy  is  developing  rapidly  .
Deng Nan  said  :  The  formulation  and  implementation  of  "  China  's  21st  Century  Agenda  COMMA  "  as  a  document  to  privide  guidance  for  the  drafting  of  national  economic  and  social  development  COMMA  will  make  it  possible  for  us  to  solve  the  past  problem  of  economic  development  divorced  from  environmental  protection  .
Deng Nan  pointed  out  :  In  drawing  up  their  programs  for  the  year  2010  and  their  Ninth  Five-Year  Plan  COMMA  various  areas  and  departments  should  pay  attention  to  embodying  the  idea  and  contents  of  "  China  's  21st  Century  Agenda  .  "
The  following  are  the  grounds  of  this  assumption  :  First  COMMA  it  is  too  late  to  negotiate  because  our  government  already  agreed  to  the  UR  basic  principles  on  15 December 1993  COMMA  presented  our  final  "  country  schedule  "  for  market  opening  COMMA  and  signed  the  final  protocol  acknowledging  the  overall  outcome  of  the  UR  round  at  Marrackech  COMMA  Morocco  COMMA  on  12 April  this  year  .
Fourth  COMMA  should  the  National Assembly  refuse  to  ratify  the  agreement  as  demanded  by  the  farmers  '  organizations  COMMA  some  civic  groups  COMMA  and  the  opposition  parties  COMMA  which  call  for  renegotiation  COMMA  our  country  would  end  up  withdrawing  from  the  Uruguay  structure  and  being  isolated  from  the  international  community  .
In  the  case  of  the  United States  COMMA  it  is  unclear  whether  the  U.S.  Congress  will  ratify  the  agreement  within  the  deadline  .
With  considerable  rough  sailing  and  difficulty  anticipated  in  the  process  of  ratification  by  the  U.S.  Congress  COMMA  the  Congress  is  hardly  expected  to  complete  the  ratification  process  within  the  time  limit  set  by  the  UR  agreement  .
As  of  early  March  COMMA  five  LDP  assemblymen  COMMA  including  Kim Pom-myon  from  Nonsan County  COMMA  reportedly  signed  the  pledge  to  vote  no  to  the  ratification  motion  .

In  another  scene  ,  President James Garfield  's  assassin  Charles Guiteau  -LRB-  Jonathan Hadary  -RRB-  prances  up  and  down  the  stairs  of  the  gallows  where  he  will  be  hanged  ,  all  the  while  singing  a  spirited  Gospel  tune  about  "  going  to  the  Lordy  .  "

Not  content  with  that  major  error  ,  the  Journal  editorial  illustrated  a  lack  of  understanding  of  the  overwhelming  evidence  in  the  Warren Commission Report  proving  that  Lee Harvey Oswald  was  the  lone  gunman  who  killed  President Kennedy  and  who  45  minutes  later  killed  Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit.
Indeed  ,  not  only  was  truth  our  only  goal  ,  but  we  found  that  truth  :  Lee Harvey Oswald  was  the  lone  gunman  who  killed  President Kennedy  and  Officer J.D. Tippit  on  that  tragic  Friday  afternoon  in  Dallas  ,  Nov.  22  ,  1963.
