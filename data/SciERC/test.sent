Recognition of proper nouns in Japanese text has been studied as a part of the more general problem of morphological analysis in Japanese text processing -LRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- -LSB- 2 -RSB- -RRB- .
It has also been studied in the framework of Japanese information extraction -LRB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- -RRB- in recent years .
Our approach to the Multi-lingual Evaluation Task -LRB- MET -RRB- for Japanese text is to consider the given task as a morphological analysis problem in Japanese .
Our morphological analyzer has done all the necessary work for the recognition and classification of proper names , numerical and temporal expressions , i.e. Named Entity -LRB- NE -RRB- items in the Japanese text .
Amorph recognizes NE items in two stages : dictionary lookup and rule application .
First , it uses several kinds of dictionaries to segment and tag Japanese character strings .
Second , based on the information resulting from the dictionary lookup stage , a set of rules is applied to the segmented strings in order to identify NE items .
We propose to incorporate a priori geometric constraints in a 3 -- D stereo reconstruction scheme to cope with the many cases where image information alone is not sufficient to accurately recover 3 -- D shape .
Our approach is based on the iterative deformation of a 3 -- D surface mesh to minimize an objective function .
We show that combining anisotropic meshing with a non-quadratic approach to regularization enables us to obtain satisfactory reconstruction results using triangulations with few vertices .
Structural or numerical constraints can then be added locally to the reconstruction process through a constrained optimization scheme .
They improve the reconstruction results and enforce their consistency with a priori knowledge about object shape .
The strong description and modeling properties of differential features make them useful tools that can be efficiently used as constraints for 3 -- D reconstruction .
It is based on a weakly supervised dependency parser that can model speech syntax without relying on any annotated training corpus .
Labeled data is replaced by a few hand-crafted rules that encode basic syntactic knowledge .
Bayesian inference then samples the rules , disambiguating and combining them to create complex tree structures that maximize a discriminative model 's posterior on a target unlabeled corpus .
This posterior encodes sparse se-lectional preferences between a head word and its dependents .
The model is evaluated on English and Czech newspaper texts , and is then validated on French broadcast news transcriptions .
Listen-Communicate-Show -LRB- LCS -RRB- is a new paradigm for human interaction with data sources .
We integrate a spoken language understanding system with intelligent mobile agents that mediate between users and information sources .
We have built and will demonstrate an application of this approach called LCS-Marine .
A domain independent model is proposed for the automated interpretation of nominal compounds in English .
This model is meant to account for productive rules of interpretation which are inferred from the morpho-syntactic and semantic characteristics of the nominal constituents .
In particular , we make extensive use of Pustejovsky 's principles concerning the predicative information associated with nominals .
We argue that it is necessary to draw a line between generalizable semantic principles and domain-specific semantic information .
We explain this distinction and we show how this model may be applied to the interpretation of compounds in real texts , provided that complementary semantic information are retrieved .
We present a new method for detecting interest points using histogram information .
Unlike existing interest point detectors , which measure pixel-wise differences in image intensity , our detectors incorporate histogram-based representations , and thus can find image regions that present a distinct distribution in the neighborhood .
The proposed detectors are able to capture large-scale structures and distinctive textured patterns , and exhibit strong invariance to rotation , illumination variation , and blur .
The experimental results show that the proposed histogram-based interest point detectors perform particularly well for the tasks of matching textured scenes under blur and illumination changes , in terms of repeatability and distinctiveness .
An extension of our method to space-time interest point detection for action classification is also presented .
We have implemented a restricted domain parser called Plume .
Building on previous work at Carnegie-Mellon University e.g. -LSB- 4 , 5 , 8 -RSB- , Plume 's approach to parsing is based on semantic caseframe instantiation .
This has the advantages of efficiency on grammatical input , and robustness in the face of ungrammatical input .
While Plume is well adapted to simple declarative and imperative utterances , it handles passives , relative clauses and interrogatives in an ad hoc manner leading to patchy syntactic coverage .
This paper outlines Plume as it currently exists and describes our detailed design for extending Plume to handle passives , relative clauses , and interrogatives in a general manner .
In this paper , we present an unlexicalized parser for German which employs smoothing and suffix analysis to achieve a labelled bracket F-score of 76.2 , higher than previously reported results on the NEGRA corpus .
In addition to the high accuracy of the model , the use of smoothing in an unlexicalized parser allows us to better examine the interplay between smoothing and parsing results .
This paper presents an unsupervised learning approach to disambiguate various relations between named entities by use of various lexical and syntactic features from the contexts .
It works by calculating eigenvectors of an adjacency graph 's Laplacian to recover a submanifold of data from a high dimensionality space and then performing cluster number estimation on the eigenvectors .
Experiment results on ACE corpora show that this spectral clustering based approach outperforms the other clustering methods .
This paper proposes a generic mathematical formalism for the combination of various structures : strings , trees , dags , graphs , and products of them .
This formalism is both elementary and powerful enough to strongly simulate many grammar formalisms , such as rewriting systems , dependency grammars , TAG , HPSG and LFG .
A mixed-signal paradigm is presented for high-resolution parallel inner-product computation in very high dimensions , suitable for efficient implementation of kernels in image processing .
At the core of the externally digital architecture is a high-density , low-power analog array performing binary-binary partial matrix-vector multiplication .
Full digital resolution is maintained even with low-resolution analog-to-digital conversion , owing to random statistics in the analog summation of binary products .
A random modulation scheme produces near-Bernoulli statistics even for highly correlated inputs .
The approach is validated with real image data , and with experimental results from a CID/DRAM analog array prototype in 0.5 cents m CMOS .
In this paper we specialize the projective unifocal , bifo-cal , and trifocal tensors to the affine case , and show how the tensors obtained relate to the registered tensors encountered in previous work .
Finally , we show how the estimation of the tensors from point correspondences is achieved through factorization , and discuss the estimation from line correspondences .
We propose a corpus-based method -LRB- Biber ,1993 ; Nagao ,1993 ; Smadja ,1993 -RRB- which generates Noun Classifier Associations -LRB- NCA -RRB- to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase .
The NCA is created statistically from a large corpus and recomposed under concept hierarchy constraints and frequency of occurrences .
The perception of transparent objects from images is known to be a very hard problem in vision .
We show how features that are imaged through a transparent object behave differently from those that are rigidly attached to the scene .
We present a novel model-based approach to recover the shapes and the poses of transparent objects from known motion .
The objects can be complex in that they may be composed of multiple layers with different refractive indices .
We have applied it to real scenes that include transparent objects and recovered the shapes of the objects with high accuracy .
We propose a novel probabilistic framework for learning visual models of 3D object categories by combining appearance information and geometric constraints .
A generative framework is used for learning a model that captures the relative position of parts within each of the discretized viewpoints .
Contrary to most of the existing mixture of viewpoints models , our model establishes explicit correspondences of parts across different viewpoints of the object class .
Given a new image , detection and classification are achieved by determining the position and viewpoint of the model that maximize recognition scores of the candidate objects .
Our approach is among the first to propose a generative proba-bilistic framework for 3D object categorization .
We test our algorithm on the detection task and the viewpoint classification task by using '' car '' category from both the Savarese et al. 2007 and PASCAL VOC 2006 datasets .
We show promising results in both the detection and viewpoint classification tasks on these two challenging datasets .
We present an application of ambiguity packing and stochastic disambiguation techniques for Lexical-Functional Grammars -LRB- LFG -RRB- to the domain of sentence condensation .
Our system incorporates a linguistic parser/generator for LFG , a transfer component for parse reduction operating on packed parse forests , and a maximum-entropy model for stochastic output selection .
Furthermore , we propose the use of standard parser evaluation methods for automatically evaluating the summarization quality of sentence condensation systems .
An experimental evaluation of summarization quality shows a close correlation between the automatic parse-based evaluation and a manual evaluation of generated strings .
Overall summarization quality of the proposed system is state-of-the-art , with guaranteed grammaticality of the system output due to the use of a constraint-based parser/generator .
The robust principal component analysis -LRB- robust PCA -RRB- problem has been considered in many machine learning applications , where the goal is to decompose the data matrix to a low rank part plus a sparse residual .
While current approaches are developed by only considering the low rank plus sparse structure , in many applications , side information of row and/or column entities may also be given , and it is still unclear to what extent could such information help robust PCA .
Thus , in this paper , we study the problem of robust PCA with side information , where both prior structure and features of entities are exploited for recovery .
We propose a convex problem to incorporate side information in robust PCA and show that the low rank matrix can be exactly recovered via the proposed method under certain conditions .
In particular , our guarantee suggests that a substantial amount of low rank matrices , which can not be recovered by standard robust PCA , become re-coverable by our proposed method .
The result theoretically justifies the effectiveness of features in robust PCA .
In addition , we conduct synthetic experiments as well as a real application on noisy image classification to show that our method also improves the performance in practice by exploiting side information .
This paper presents necessary and sufficient conditions for the use of demonstrative expressions in English and discusses implications for current discourse processing algorithms .
This research is part of a larger study of anaphoric expressions , the results of which will be incorporated into a natural language generation system .
Using the IEMOCAP database , discrete -LRB- categorical -RRB- and continuous -LRB- attribute -RRB- emotional assessments evaluated by the actors and na ¨ ıve listeners are compared .
The problem of blind separation of underdetermined instantaneous mixtures of independent signals is addressed through a method relying on nonstationarity of the original signals .
In comparison with previous works , in this paper it is assumed that the signals are not i.i.d. in each epoch , but obey a first-order autoregressive model .
This model was shown to be more appropriate for blind separation of natural speech signals .
A separation method is proposed that is nearly statistically efficient -LRB- approaching the corresponding Cramér-Rao lower bound -RRB- , if the separated signals obey the assumed model .
In the case of natural speech signals , the method is shown to have separation accuracy better than the state-of-the-art methods .
This paper proposes to use a convolution kernel over parse trees to model syntactic structure information for relation extraction .
Our study reveals that the syntactic structure features embedded in a parse tree are very effective for relation extraction and these features can be well captured by the convolution tree kernel .
Evaluation on the ACE 2003 corpus shows that the convolution kernel over parse trees can achieve comparable performance with the previous best-reported feature-based methods on the 24 ACE relation subtypes .
It also shows that our method significantly outperforms the previous two dependency tree kernels on the 5 ACE relation major types .
This paper presents the results of automatically inducing a Combinatory Categorial Grammar -LRB- CCG -RRB- lexicon from a Turkish dependency treebank .
The fact that Turkish is an agglutinating free word order language presents a challenge for language theories .
We explored possible ways to obtain a compact lexicon , consistent with CCG principles , from a treebank which is an order of magnitude smaller than Penn WSJ .
While sentence extraction as an approach to summarization has been shown to work in documents of certain genres , because of the conversational nature of email communication where utterances are made in relation to one made previously , sentence extraction may not capture the necessary segments of dialogue that would make a summary coherent .
In this paper , we present our work on the detection of question-answer pairs in an email conversation for the task of email summarization .
We show that various features based on the structure of email-threads can be used to improve upon lexical similarity of discourse segments for question-answer pairing .
Specifically , we show how to incorporate a simple prior on the distribution of natural images into support vector machines .
SVMs are known to be robust to overfitting ; however , a few training examples usually do not represent well the structure of the class .
Our experiments on real data sets show that the resulting detector is more robust to the choice of training examples , and substantially improves both linear and kernel SVM when trained on 10 positive and 10 negative examples .
Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal , it has been very difficult to develop a unified framework for reasoning about it at a technical level , and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community .
Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting -LRB- and unavoidable -RRB- trade-offs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage , sum-of-pairs , k-means , and k-median .
With relevant approach , we identify important contents by PageRank algorithm on the event map constructed from documents .
We present a scanning method that recovers dense sub-pixel camera-projector correspondence without requiring any photometric calibration nor preliminary knowledge of their relative geometry .
Subpixel accuracy is achieved by considering several zero-crossings defined by the difference between pairs of unstructured patterns .
We use gray-level band-pass white noise patterns that increase robustness to indirect lighting and scene discontinuities .
Simulated and experimental results show that our method recovers scene geometry with high subpixel precision , and that it can handle many challenges of active reconstruction systems .
We compare our results to state of the art methods such as mi-cro phase shifting and modulated phase shifting .
This paper describes a novel system for acquiring adjectival subcategorization frames -LRB- scfs -RRB- and associated frequency information from English corpus data .
The system incorporates a decision-tree classifier for 30 scf types which tests for the presence of grammatical relations -LRB- grs -RRB- in the output of a robust statistical parser .
It uses a powerful pattern-matching language to classify grs into frames hierarchically in a way that mirrors inheritance-based lexica .
The experiments show that the system is able to detect scf types with 70 % precision and 66 % recall rate .
A new tool for linguistic annotation of scfs in corpus data is also introduced which can considerably alleviate the process of obtaining training and test data for subcategorization acquisition .
Machine transliteration/back-transliteration plays an important role in many multilingual speech and language applications .
In this paper , a novel framework for machine transliteration/backtransliteration that allows us to carry out direct orthographical mapping -LRB- DOM -RRB- between two different languages is presented .
Under this framework , a joint source-channel transliteration model , also called n-gram transliteration model -LRB- n-gram TM -RRB- , is further proposed to model the transliteration process .
We evaluate the proposed methods through several transliteration/backtransliteration experiments for English/Chinese and English/Japanese language pairs .
Our study reveals that the proposed method not only reduces an extensive system development effort but also improves the transliteration accuracy significantly .
A bio-inspired model for an analog programmable array processor -LRB- APAP -RRB- , based on studies on the vertebrate retina , has permitted the realization of complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics in VLSI .
This model mimics the way in which images are processed in the visual pathway , rendering a feasible alternative for the implementation of early vision applications in standard technologies .
Computing power per area and power consumption is amongst the highest reported for a single chip .
Another problem with determiners is their inherent ambiguity .
In this paper we propose a logical formalism , which , among other things , is suitable for representing determiners without forcing a particular interpretation when their meaning is still not clear .
We investigate the verbal and nonverbal means for grounding , and propose a design for embodied conversational agents that relies on both kinds of signals to establish common ground in human-computer interaction .
We analyzed eye gaze , head nods and attentional focus in the context of a direction-giving task .
Based on these results , we present an ECA that uses verbal and nonverbal grounding acts to update dialogue state .
Sentence boundary detection in speech is important for enriching speech recognition output , making it easier for humans to read and downstream modules to process .
In previous work , we have developed hidden Markov model -LRB- HMM -RRB- and maximum entropy -LRB- Maxent -RRB- classifiers that integrate textual and prosodic knowledge sources for detecting sentence boundaries .
In this paper , we evaluate the use of a conditional random field -LRB- CRF -RRB- for this task and relate results with this model to our prior work .
We evaluate across two corpora -LRB- conversational telephone speech and broadcast news speech -RRB- on both human transcriptions and speech recognition output .
In general , our CRF model yields a lower error rate than the HMM and Max-ent models on the NIST sentence boundary detection task in speech , although it is interesting to note that the best results are achieved by three-way voting among the classifiers .
This probably occurs because each model has different strengths and weaknesses for modeling the knowledge sources .
We propose a novel approach to associate objects across multiple PTZ cameras that can be used to perform camera handoff in wide-area surveillance scenarios .
While previous approaches relied on geometric , appearance , or correlation-based information for establishing correspondences between static cameras , they each have well-known limitations and are not extendable to wide-area settings with PTZ cameras .
Towards this goal , we also propose a novel Multiple Instance Learning -LRB- MIL -RRB- formulation for the problem based on the logistic softmax function of covariance-based region features within a MAP estimation framework .
We demonstrate our approach with multiple PTZ camera sequences in typical outdoor surveillance settings and show a comparison with state-of-the-art approaches .
This paper solves a specialized regression problem to obtain sampling probabilities for records in databases .
The goal is to sample a small set of records over which evaluating aggregate queries can be done both efficiently and accurately .
We provide a principled and provable solution for this problem ; it is parameterless and requires no data insights .
Moreover , a cost zero solution always exists and can only be excluded by hard budget constraints .
Our extensive experimental results significantly improve over both uniform sampling and standard stratified sampling which are de-facto the industry standards .
We consider the problem of computing the Kullback-Leibler distance , also called the relative entropy , between a probabilistic context-free grammar and a probabilistic finite automaton .
We show that there is a closed-form -LRB- analytical -RRB- solution for one part of the Kullback-Leibler distance , viz the cross-entropy .
We discuss several applications of the result to the problem of distributional approximation of probabilistic context-free grammars by means of probabilistic finite automata .
In spite of over two decades of intense research , illumination and pose invariance remain prohibitively challenging aspects of face recognition for most practical applications .
The objective of this work is to recognize faces using video sequences both for training and recognition input , in a realistic , unconstrained setup in which lighting , pose and user motion pattern have a wide variability and face images are of low resolution .
In particular there are three areas of novelty : -LRB- i -RRB- we show how a photometric model of image formation can be combined with a statistical model of generic face appearance variation , learnt offline , to generalize in the presence of extreme illumination changes ; -LRB- ii -RRB- we use the smoothness of geodesically local appearance manifold structure and a robust same-identity likelihood to achieve invariance to unseen head poses ; and -LRB- iii -RRB- we introduce an accurate video sequence '' reillumination '' algorithm to achieve robustness to face motion patterns in video .
We describe a fully automatic recognition system based on the proposed method and an extensive evaluation on 171 individuals and over 1300 video sequences with extreme illumination , pose and head motion variation .
On this challenging data set our system consistently demonstrated a nearly perfect recognition rate -LRB- over 99.7 % on all three databases -RRB- , significantly out-performing state-of-the-art commercial software and methods from the literature .
We present Minimum Bayes-Risk -LRB- MBR -RRB- decoding for statistical machine translation .
This statistical approach aims to minimize expected loss of translation errors under loss functions that measure translation performance .
We describe a hierarchy of loss functions that incorporate different levels of linguistic information from word strings , word-to-word alignments from an MT system , and syntactic structure from parse-trees of source and target language sentences .
We report the performance of the MBR decoders on a Chinese-to-English translation task .
Our results show that MBR decoding can be used to tune statistical MT performance for specific loss functions .
This paper presents a critical discussion of the various approaches that have been used in the evaluation of Natural Language systems .
We conclude that previous approaches have neglected to evaluate systems in the context of their use , e.g. solving a task requiring data retrieval .
In the second half of the paper , we report a laboratory study using the Wizard of Oz technique to identify NL requirements for carrying out this task .
We evaluate the demands that task dialogues collected using this technique , place upon a prototype Natural Language system .
We present results on addressee identification in four-participants face-to-face meetings using Bayesian Network and Naive Bayes classifiers .
First , we investigate how well the addressee of a dialogue act can be predicted based on gaze , utterance and conversational context features .
Both classifiers perform the best when conversational context and utterance features are combined with speaker 's gaze information .
Towards deep analysis of compositional classes of paraphrases , we have examined a class-oriented framework for collecting paraphrase examples , in which sentential paraphrases are collected for each paraphrase class separately by means of automatic candidate generation and manual judgement .
The purpose of this research is to test the efficacy of applying automated evaluation techniques , originally devised for the evaluation of human language learners , to the output of machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- systems .
We believe that these evaluation techniques will provide information about both the human language learning process , the translation process and the development of machine translation systems .
A language learning experiment showed that assessors can differentiate native from non-native language essays in less than 100 words .
Some of the extracts were expert human translations , others were machine translation outputs .
The subjects were given three minutes per extract to determine whether they believed the sample output to be an expert human translation or a machine translation .
This paper presents a machine learning approach to bare slice disambiguation in dialogue .
We extract a set of heuristic principles from a corpus-based sample and formulate them as probabilistic Horn clauses .
We then use the predicates of such clauses to create a set of domain independent features to annotate an input dataset , and run two different machine learning algorithms : SLIPPER , a rule-based learning algorithm , and TiMBL , a memory-based system .
The results show that the features in terms of which we formulate our heuristic principles have significant predictive power , and that rules that closely resemble our Horn clauses can be learnt automatically from these features .
We suggest a new goal and evaluation criterion for word similarity measures .
The new criterion -- meaning-entailing substitutability -- fits the needs of semantic-oriented NLP applications and can be evaluated directly -LRB- independent of an application -RRB- at a good level of human agreement .
Motivated by this semantic criterion we analyze the empirical quality of distributional word feature vectors and its impact on word similarity results , proposing an objective measure for evaluating feature vector quality .
Finally , a novel feature weighting and selection function is presented , which yields superior feature vectors and better word similarity performance .
This phenomenon causes many image processing techniques to fail as they assume the presence of only one layer at each examined site e.g. motion estimation and object recognition .
This work presents an automated technique for detecting reflections in image sequences by analyzing motion trajectories of feature points .
It models reflection as regions containing two different layers moving over each other .
We present a strong detector based on combining a set of weak detectors .
We use novel priors , generate sparse and dense detection maps and our results show high detection rate with rejection to pathological motion and occlusion .
This paper considers the problem of reconstructing the motion of a 3D articulated tree from 2D point correspondences subject to some temporal prior .
Hitherto , smooth motion has been encouraged using a trajectory basis , yielding a hard combinatorial problem with time complexity growing exponentially in the number of frames .
Branch and bound strategies have previously attempted to curb this complexity whilst maintaining global optimality .
However , they provide no guarantee of being more efficient than exhaustive search .
Extension to affine projection enables reconstruction without estimating cameras .
Topical blog post retrieval is the task of ranking blog posts with respect to their relevance for a given topic .
To improve topical blog post retrieval we incorporate textual credibility indicators in the retrieval process .
We describe how to estimate these indicators and how to integrate them into a retrieval approach based on language models .
Experiments on the TREC Blog track test set show that both groups of credibility indicators significantly improve retrieval effectiveness ; the best performance is achieved when combining them .
We investigate the problem of learning to predict moves in the board game of Go from game records of expert players .
This distribution has numerous applications in computer Go , including serving as an efficient stand-alone Go player .
It would also be effective as a move selector and move sorter for game tree search and as a training tool for Go players .
Our method has two major components : a -RRB- a pattern extraction scheme for efficiently harvesting patterns of given size and shape from expert game records and b -RRB- a Bayesian learning algorithm -LRB- in two variants -RRB- that learns a distribution over the values of a move given a board position based on the local pattern context .
The system is trained on 181,000 expert games and shows excellent prediction performance as indicated by its ability to perfectly predict the moves made by professional Go players in 34 % of test positions .
We present a novel approach for automatically acquiring English topic signatures .
Topic signatures can be useful in a number of Natural Language Processing -LRB- NLP -RRB- applications , such as Word Sense Disambiguation -LRB- WSD -RRB- and Text Summarisation .
Our method takes advantage of the different way in which word senses are lexicalised in English and Chinese , and also exploits the large amount of Chinese text available in corpora and on the Web .
We evaluated the topic signatures on a WSD task , where we trained a second-order vector cooccurrence algorithm on standard WSD datasets , with promising results .
Joint matrix triangularization is often used for estimating the joint eigenstructure of a set M of matrices , with applications in signal processing and machine learning .
Our main result is a first-order upper bound on the distance between any approximate joint triangularizer of the matrices in M ' and any exact joint triangularizer of the matrices in M .
To our knowledge , this is the first a posteriori bound for joint matrix decomposition .
The psycholinguistic literature provides evidence for syntactic priming , i.e. , the tendency to repeat structures .
This paper describes a method for incorporating priming into an incremental probabilistic parser .
These models simulate the reading time advantage for parallel structures found in human data , and also yield a small increase in overall parsing accuracy .
Learned confidence measures gain increasing importance for outlier removal and quality improvement in stereo vision .
However , acquiring the necessary training data is typically a tedious and time consuming task that involves manual interaction , active sensing devices and/or synthetic scenes .
The key idea of our approach is to use different view points for reasoning about contradictions and consistencies between multiple depth maps generated with the same stereo algorithm .
Among other experiments , we demonstrate the potential of our approach by boosting the performance of three learned confidence measures on the KITTI2012 dataset by simply training them on a vast amount of automatically generated training data rather than a limited amount of laser ground truth data .
An important area of learning in autonomous agents is the ability to learn domain-speciic models of actions to be used by planning systems .
These methods diier from previous work in the area in two ways : the use of an action model formalism which is better suited to the needs of a re-active agent , and successful implementation of noise-handling mechanisms .
Training instances are generated from experience and observation , and a variant of GOLEM is used to learn action models from these instances .
The integrated learning system has been experimentally validated in simulated construction and ooce domains .
This paper describes FERRET , an interactive question-answering -LRB- Q/A -RRB- system designed to address the challenges of integrating automatic Q/A applications into real-world environments .
FERRET utilizes a novel approach to Q/A known as predictive questioning which attempts to identify the questions -LRB- and answers -RRB- that users need by analyzing how a user interacts with a system while gathering information related to a particular scenario .
In order to build robust automatic abstracting systems , there is a need for better training resources than are currently available .
In this paper , we introduce an annotation scheme for scientific articles which can be used to build such a resource in a consistent way .
The seven categories of the scheme are based on rhetorical moves of argumentation .
The automated segmentation of images into semantically meaningful parts requires shape information since low-level feature analysis alone often fails to reach this goal .
We introduce a novel method of shape constrained image segmentation which is based on mixtures of feature distributions for color and texture as well as probabilistic shape knowledge .
The combined approach is formulated in the framework of Bayesian statistics to account for the robust-ness requirement in image understanding .
The goal of this work is the enrichment of human-machine interactions in a natural language environment .
This paper highlights a particular class of miscommunication -- reference problems -- by describing a case study and techniques for avoiding failures of reference .
This paper examines the benefits of system combination for unsupervised WSD .
We investigate several voting - and arbiter-based combination strategies over a diverse pool of unsupervised WSD systems .
Our combination methods rely on predominant senses which are derived automatically from raw text .
Experiments using the SemCor and Senseval-3 data sets demonstrate that our ensembles yield significantly better results when compared with state-of-the-art .
The applicability of many current information extraction techniques is severely limited by the need for supervised training data .
We demonstrate that for certain field structured extraction tasks , such as classified advertisements and bibliographic citations , small amounts of prior knowledge can be used to learn effective models in a primarily unsupervised fashion .
Although hidden Markov models -LRB- HMMs -RRB- provide a suitable generative model for field structured text , general unsupervised HMM learning fails to learn useful structure in either of our domains .
In both domains , we found that unsupervised methods can attain accuracies with 400 unlabeled examples comparable to those attained by supervised methods on 50 labeled examples , and that semi-supervised methods can make good use of small amounts of labeled data .
This paper gives an overall account of a prototype natural language question answering system , called Chat-80 .
The system is implemented entirely in Prolog , a programming language based on logic .
With the aid of a logic-based grammar formalism called extraposition grammars , Chat-80 translates English questions into the Prolog subset of logic .
The resulting logical expression is then transformed by a planning algorithm into efficient Prolog , cf. query optimisation in a relational database .
Human action recognition from well-segmented 3D skeleton data has been intensively studied and attracting an increasing attention .
Online action detection goes one step further and is more challenging , which identifies the action type and localizes the action positions on the fly from the untrimmed stream .
In this paper , we study the problem of online action detection from the streaming skeleton data .
We propose a multi-task end-to-end Joint Classification-Regression Recurrent Neural Network to better explore the action type and temporal localiza-tion information .
By employing a joint classification and regression optimization objective , this network is capable of automatically localizing the start and end points of actions more accurately .
Specifically , by leveraging the merits of the deep Long Short-Term Memory -LRB- LSTM -RRB- subnetwork , the proposed model automatically captures the complex long-range temporal dynamics , which naturally avoids the typical sliding window design and thus ensures high computational efficiency .
To evaluate our proposed model , we build a large streaming video dataset with annotations .
Experimental results on our dataset and the public G3D dataset both demonstrate very promising performance of our scheme .
The task of machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- evaluation is closely related to the task of sentence-level semantic equivalence classification .
This paper investigates the utility of applying standard MT evaluation methods -LRB- BLEU , NIST , WER and PER -RRB- to building classifiers to predict semantic equivalence and entailment .
We also introduce a novel classification method based on PER which leverages part of speech information of the words contributing to the word matches and non-matches in the sentence .
Our results show that MT evaluation techniques are able to produce useful features for paraphrase classification and to a lesser extent entailment .
Our technique gives a substantial improvement in paraphrase classification accuracy over all of the other models used in the experiments .
Given an object model and a black-box measure of similarity between the model and candidate targets , we consider visual object tracking as a numerical optimization problem .
During normal tracking conditions when the object is visible from frame to frame , local optimization is used to track the local mode of the similarity measure in a parameter space of translation , rotation and scale .
However , when the object becomes partially or totally occluded , such local tracking is prone to failure , especially when common prediction techniques like the Kalman filter do not provide a good estimate of object parameters in future frames .
To recover from these inevitable tracking failures , we consider object detection as a global optimization problem and solve it via Adaptive Simulated Annealing -LRB- ASA -RRB- , a method that avoids becoming trapped at local modes and is much faster than exhaustive search .
As a Monte Carlo approach , ASA stochastically samples the parameter space , in contrast to local deterministic search .
We apply cluster analysis on the sampled parameter space to redetect the object and renew the local tracker .
Our numerical hybrid local and global mode-seeking tracker is validated on challenging airborne videos with heavy occlusion and large camera motions .
Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art trackers on the VIVID benchmark datasets .
Techniques for automatically training modules of a natural language generator have recently been proposed , but a fundamental concern is whether the quality of utterances produced with trainable components can compete with hand-crafted template-based or rule-based approaches .
In this paper We experimentally evaluate a trainable sentence planner for a spoken dialogue system by eliciting subjective human judgments .
In order to perform an exhaustive comparison , we also evaluate a hand-crafted template-based generation component , two rule-based sentence planners , and two baseline sentence planners .
We show that the trainable sentence planner performs better than the rule-based systems and the baselines , and as well as the hand-crafted system .
A new algorithm is proposed for novel view generation in one-to-one teleconferencing applications .
Given the video streams acquired by two cameras placed on either side of a computer monitor , the proposed algorithm synthesises images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position -LRB- typically located within the monitor -RRB- to facilitate eye contact .
Our technique is based on an improved , dynamic-programming , stereo algorithm for efficient novel-view generation .
The two main contributions of this paper are : i -RRB- a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming , that encourages correct occlusion labeling ; ii -RRB- a compact geometric derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost surface .
Furthermore , this paper presents a novel algorithm for the temporal maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions and reduce temporal artefacts -LRB- flicker -RRB- ; and a cost aggregation algorithm that acts directly on our three-dimensional matching cost space .
Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm to spatial and temporal artefacts for long stereo video streams .
We further demonstrate synthesis from a freely translating virtual camera .
To a large extent , these statistics reflect semantic constraints and thus are used to disambiguate anaphora references and syntactic ambiguities .
The results of the experiment show that in most of the cases the cooccurrence statistics indeed reflect the semantic constraints and thus provide a basis for a useful disambiguation tool .
We present a novel method for discovering parallel sentences in comparable , non-parallel corpora .
Using this approach , we extract parallel data from large Chinese , Arabic , and English non-parallel newspaper corpora .
We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system .
We also show that a good-quality MT system can be built from scratch by starting with a very small parallel corpus -LRB- 100,000 words -RRB- and exploiting a large non-parallel corpus .
Thus , our method can be applied with great benefit to language pairs for which only scarce resources are available .
In this paper , we describe a search procedure for statistical machine translation -LRB- MT -RRB- based on dynamic programming -LRB- DP -RRB- .
Starting from a DP-based solution to the traveling salesman problem , we present a novel technique to restrict the possible word reordering between source and target language in order to achieve an efficient search algorithm .
The experimental tests are carried out on the Verbmobil task -LRB- German-English , 8000-word vocabulary -RRB- , which is a limited-domain spoken-language task .
A purely functional implementation of LR-parsers is given , together with a simple correctness proof .
It is presented as a generalization of the recursive descent parser .
For non-LR grammars the time-complexity of our parser is cubic if the functions that constitute the parser are implemented as memo-functions , i.e. functions that memorize the results of previous invocations .
Memo-functions also facilitate a simple way to construct a very compact representation of the parse forest .
For LR -LRB- 0 -RRB- grammars , our algorithm is closely related to the recursive ascent parsers recently discovered by Kruse-man Aretz -LSB- 1 -RSB- and Roberts -LSB- 2 -RSB- .
Extended CF grammars -LRB- grammars with regular expressions at the right hand side -RRB- can be parsed with a simple modification of the LR-parser for normal CF grammars .
In this theory , discourse structure is composed of three separate but interrelated components : the structure of the sequence of utterances -LRB- called the linguistic structure -RRB- , a structure of purposes -LRB- called the intentional structure -RRB- , and the state of focus of attention -LRB- called the attentional state -RRB- .
The intentional structure captures the discourse-relevant purposes , expressed in each of the linguistic segments as well as relationships among them .
The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such discourse phenomena as cue phrases , referring expressions , and interruptions .
We examine the relationship between the two grammatical formalisms : Tree Adjoining Grammars and Head Grammars .
We then turn to a discussion comparing the linguistic expressiveness of the two formalisms .
We provide a unified account of sentence-level and text-level anaphora within the framework of a dependency-based grammar model .
Criteria for anaphora resolution within sentence boundaries rephrase major concepts from GB 's binding theory , while those for text-level anaphora incorporate an adapted version of a Grosz-Sidner-style focus model .
Coedition of a natural language text and its representation in some interlingual form seems the best and simplest way to share text revision across languages .
The modified graph is then sent to the UNL-L0 deconverter and the result shown .
On the internal side , liaisons are established between elements of the text and the graph by using broadly available resources such as a LO-English or better a L0-UNL dictionary , a morphosyntactic parser of L0 , and a canonical graph2tree transformation .
Establishing a `` best '' correspondence between the '' UNL-tree + L0 '' and the '' MS-L0 structure '' , a lattice , may be done using the dictionary and trying to align the tree and the selected trajectory with as few crossing liaisons as possible .
A central goal of this research is to merge approaches from pivot MT , interactive MT , and multilingual text authoring .
We report experiments conducted on a multilingual corpus to estimate the number of analogies among the sentences that it contains .
Our goal is to learn a Mahalanobis distance by minimizing a loss defined on the weighted sum of the precision at different ranks .
Our core motivation is that minimizing a weighted rank loss is a natural criterion for many problems in computer vision such as person re-identification .
We propose a novel metric learning formulation called Weighted Approximate Rank Component Analysis -LRB- WARCA -RRB- .
We then derive a scalable stochastic gradient descent algorithm for the resulting learning problem .
We also derive an efficient non-linear extension of WARCA by using the kernel trick .
Kernel space embedding decouples the training and prediction costs from the data dimension and enables us to plug inarbitrary distance measures which are more natural for the features .
We also address a more general problem of matrix rank degeneration & non-isolated minima in the low-rank matrix optimization by using new type of regularizer which approximately enforces the or-thonormality of the learned matrix very efficiently .
We validate this new method on nine standard person re-identification datasets including two large scale Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets and show that we improve upon the current state-of-the-art methods on all of them .
In this paper , we discuss language model adaptation methods given a word list and a raw corpus .
In this situation , the general method is to segment the raw corpus automatically using a word list , correct the output sentences by hand , and build a model from the segmented corpus .
In the experiments , we used a variety of methods for preparing a segmented corpus and compared the language models by their speech recognition accuracies .
Many practical modeling problems involve discrete data that are best represented as draws from multinomial or categorical distributions .
For example , nucleotides in a DNA sequence , children 's names in a given state and year , and text documents are all commonly modeled with multinomial distributions .
Here , we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in Pólya-gamma augmentation to reformu-late the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods , enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead .
MINPRAN , a new robust operator , nds good ts in data sets where more than 50 % of the points are outliers .
Unlike other techniques that handle large outlier percentages , MINPRAN does not rely on a known error bound for the good data .
Based on this , MINPRAN uses random sampling to search for the t and the number of inliers to the t that are least likely to have occurred randomly .
MINPRAN 's properties are connrmed experimentally on synthetic data and compare favorably to least median of squares .
Related work applies MINPRAN to complex range and intensity data 23 -RSB- .
Metagrammatical formalisms that combine context-free phrase structure rules and metarules -LRB- MPS grammars -RRB- allow concise statement of generalizations about the syntax of natural languages .
We evaluate several proposals for constraining them , basing our assessment on computational tractability and explanatory adequacy .
The unique properties of tree-adjoining grammars -LRB- TAG -RRB- present a challenge for the application of TAGs beyond the limited confines of syntax , for instance , to the task of semantic interpretation or automatic translation of natural language .
The formalism 's intended usage is to relate expressions of natural languages to their associated semantics represented in a logical form language , or to their translates in another natural language ; in summary , we intend it to allow TAGs to be used beyond their role in syntax proper .
A model-based approach to on-line cursive handwriting analysis and recognition is presented and evaluated .
In this model , on-line handwriting is considered as a modulation of a simple cycloidal pen motion , described by two coupled oscillations with a constant linear drift along the line of the writing .
A general procedure for the estimation and quantization of these cycloidal motion parameters for arbitrary handwriting is presented .
The result is a discrete motor control representation of the continuous pen motion , via the quantized levels of the model parameters .
This motor control representation enables successful word spotting and matching of cursive scripts .
Our experiments clearly indicate the potential of this dynamic representation for complete cursive handwriting recognition .
In the Object Recognition task , there exists a di-chotomy between the categorization of objects and estimating object pose , where the former necessitates a view-invariant representation , while the latter requires a representation capable of capturing pose information over different categories of objects .
With the rise of deep archi-tectures , the prime focus has been on object category recognition .
In contrast , object pose estimation using these approaches has received relatively less attention .
In this work , we study how Convolutional Neural Networks -LRB- CNN -RRB- architectures can be adapted to the task of simultaneous object recognition and pose estimation .
We investigate and analyze the layers of various CNN models and extensively compare between them with the goal of discovering how the layers of distributed representations within CNNs represent object pose information and how this contradicts with object category representations .
It is particularly valuable to empirical MT research .
In this paper , we explore geometric structures of 3D lines in ray space for improving light field triangulation and stereo matching .
Such a triangulation provides a piecewise-linear interpolant useful for light field super-resolution .
Experiments on synthetic and real data show that both our triangulation and LAGC algorithms outperform state-of-the-art solutions in accuracy and visual quality .
This paper presents a phrase-based statistical machine translation method , based on non-contiguous phrases , i.e. phrases with gaps .
A method for producing such phrases from a word-aligned corpora is proposed .
A statistical translation model is also presented that deals such phrases , as well as a training method based on the maximization of translation accuracy , as measured with the NIST evaluation metric .
Translations are produced by means of a beam-search decoder .
GLOSSER is designed to support reading and learning to read in a foreign language .
There are four language pairs currently supported by GLOSSER : English-Bulgarian , English-Estonian , English-Hungarian and French-Dutch .
A demonstration -LRB- in UNIX -RRB- for Applied Natural Language Processing emphasizes components put to novel technical uses in intelligent computer-assisted morphological analysis -LRB- ICALL -RRB- , including disambiguated morphological analysis and lemmatized indexing for an aligned bilingual corpus of word examples .
We present a new part-of-speech tagger that demonstrates the following ideas : -LRB- i -RRB- explicit use of both preceding and following tag contexts via a dependency network representation , -LRB- ii -RRB- broad use of lexical features , including jointly conditioning on multiple consecutive words , -LRB- iii -RRB- effective use of priors in conditional loglinear models , and -LRB- iv -RRB- fine-grained modeling of unknown word features .
Using these ideas together , the resulting tagger gives a 97.24 % accuracy on the Penn Treebank WSJ , an error reduction of 4.4 % on the best previous single automatically learned tagging result .
Owing to these variations , the pedestrian data is distributed as highly-curved manifolds in the feature space , despite the current convolutional neural networks -LRB- CNN -RRB- 's capability of feature extraction .
In practice , the current deep embedding methods use the Euclidean distance for the training and test .
On the other hand , the manifold learning methods suggest to use the Euclidean distance in the local range , combining with the graphical relationship between samples , for approximating the geodesic distance .
From this point of view , selecting suitable positive -LRB- i.e. intra-class -RRB- training samples within a local range is critical for training the CNN embedding , especially when the data has large intra-class variations .
In this paper , we propose a novel moderate positive sample mining method to train robust CNN for person re-identification , dealing with the problem of large variation .
In addition , we improve the learning by a metric weight constraint , so that the learned metric has a better generalization ability .
Experiments show that these two strategies are effective in learning robust deep metrics for person re-identification , and accordingly our deep model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks of person re-identification .
Therefore , the study presented in this paper may be useful in inspiring new designs of deep models for person re-identification .
Utterance Verification -LRB- UV -RRB- is a critical function of an Automatic Speech Recognition -LRB- ASR -RRB- System working on real applications where spontaneous speech , out-of-vocabulary -LRB- OOV -RRB- words and acoustic noises are present .
In this paper we present a new UV procedure with two major features : a -RRB- Confidence tests are applied to decoded string hypotheses obtained from using word and garbage models that represent OOV words and noises .
Thus the ASR system is designed to deal with what we refer to as Word Spotting and Noise Spotting capabilities .
b -RRB- The UV procedure is based on three different confidence tests , two based on acoustic measures and one founded on linguistic information , applied in a hierarchical structure .
Experimental results from a real telephone application on a natural number recognition task show an 50 % reduction in recognition errors with a moderate 12 % rejection rate of correct utterances and a low 1.5 % rate of false acceptance .
A critical step in encoding sound for neuronal processing occurs when the analog pressure wave is coded into discrete nerve-action potentials .
Recent pool models of the inner hair cell synapse do not reproduce the dead time period after an intense stimulus , so we used visual inspection and automatic speech recognition -LRB- ASR -RRB- to investigate an offset adaptation -LRB- OA -RRB- model proposed by Zhang et al. -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
OA improved phase locking in the auditory nerve -LRB- AN -RRB- and raised ASR accuracy for features derived from AN fibers -LRB- ANFs -RRB- .
We also found that OA is crucial for auditory processing by onset neurons -LRB- ONs -RRB- in the next neuronal stage , the auditory brainstem .
Multi-layer perceptrons -LRB- MLPs -RRB- performed much better than standard Gaussian mixture models -LRB- GMMs -RRB- for both our ANF-based and ON-based auditory features .
Recent progress in computer vision has been driven by high-capacity models trained on large datasets .
Unfortunately , creating large datasets with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required .
In this paper , we present an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games .
We propose a novel step toward the unsupervised seg-mentation of whole objects by combining '' hints '' of partial scene segmentation offered by multiple soft , binary mattes .
These mattes are implied by a set of hypothesized object boundary fragments in the scene .
This reflects contemporary methods for unsupervised object discovery from groups of images , and it allows us to define intuitive evaluation met-rics for our sets of segmentations based on the accurate and parsimonious delineation of scene objects .
Our proposed approach builds on recent advances in spectral clustering , image matting , and boundary detection .
It is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively on a dataset of scenes and is suitable for current work in unsupervised object discovery without top-down knowledge .
Language resource quality is crucial in NLP .
Many of the resources used are derived from data created by human beings out of an NLP context , especially regarding MT and reference translations .
Indeed , automatic evaluations need high-quality data that allow the comparison of both automatic and human translations .
This paper describes the impact of using different-quality references on evaluation .
Thus , the limitations of the automatic metrics used within MT are also discussed in this regard .
This poster paper describes a full scale two-level morphological description -LRB- Karttunen , 1983 ; Koskenniemi , 1983 -RRB- of Turkish word structures .
The description has been implemented using the PC-KIMMO environment -LRB- Antworth , 1990 -RRB- and is based on a root word lexicon of about 23,000 roots words .
Turkish is an agglutinative language with word structures formed by productive affixations of derivational and inflectional suffixes to root words .
The surface realizations of morphological constructions are constrained and modified by a number of phonetic rules such as vowel harmony .
This paper deals with the problem of generating the fundamental frequency -LRB- F0 -RRB- contour of speech from a text input for text-to-speech synthesis .
We have previously introduced a statistical model describing the generating process of speech F0 contours , based on the discrete-time version of the Fujisaki model .
One remarkable feature of this model is that it has allowed us to derive an efficient algorithm based on powerful statistical methods for estimating the Fujisaki-model parameters from raw F0 contours .
To associate a sequence of the Fujisaki-model parameters with a text input based on statistical learning , this paper proposes extending this model to a context-dependent one .
We further propose a parameter training algorithm for the present model based on a decision tree-based context clustering .
We introduce a method to accelerate the evaluation of object detection cascades with the help of a divide-and-conquer procedure in the space of candidate regions .
Compared to the exhaustive procedure that thus far is the state-of-the-art for cascade evaluation , the proposed method requires fewer evaluations of the classifier functions , thereby speeding up the search .
Furthermore , we show how the recently developed efficient subwindow search -LRB- ESS -RRB- procedure -LSB- 11 -RSB- can be integrated into the last stage of our method .
This allows us to use our method to act not only as a faster procedure for cascade evaluation , but also as a tool to perform efficient branch-and-bound object detection with nonlinear quality functions , in particular kernel-ized support vector machines .
Experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2006 dataset show an acceleration of more than 50 % by our method compared to standard cascade evaluation .
Background modeling is an important component of many vision systems .
When the scene exhibits a persistent dynamic behavior in time , such an assumption is violated and detection performance deteriorates .
In this paper , we propose a new method for the modeling and subtraction of such scenes .
Towards the modeling of the dynamic characteristics , optical flow is computed and utilized as a feature in a higher dimensional space .
Inherent ambiguities in the computation of features are addressed by using a data-dependent bandwidth for density estimation using kernels .
In this paper , we present our approach for using information extraction annotations to augment document retrieval for distillation .
This paper presents a novel representation for three-dimensional objects in terms of affine-invariant image patches and their spatial relationships .
Multi-view constraints associated with groups of patches are combined with a normalized representation of their appearance to guide matching and reconstruction , allowing the acquisition of true three-dimensional affine and Euclidean models from multiple images and their recognition in a single photograph taken from an arbitrary viewpoint .
The proposed approach does not require a separate segmentation stage and is applicable to cluttered scenes .
Fast algorithms for nearest neighbor -LRB- NN -RRB- search have in large part focused on 2 distance .
Here we develop an approach for 1 distance that begins with an explicit and exactly distance-preserving embedding of the points into 2 2 .
We show how this can efficiently be combined with random-projection based methods for 2 NN search , such as locality-sensitive hashing -LRB- LSH -RRB- or random projection trees .
We rigorously establish the correctness of the methodology and show by experimentation using LSH that it is competitive in practice with available alternatives .
