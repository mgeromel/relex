The naval Battle of Salis took place during the Polish–Swedish War ( 1600–1611 ) during the night of March 23–24 , 1609 .
After the capture of Pärnu , Jan Karol Chodkiewicz , commander of the Lithuanian army , moved towards Riga , which was occupied by the Swedes under the command of Joachim Frederick von Mansfeld .
Along the way , Chodkiewicz saw a chance to destroy the Swedish squadron based in the Salis port which blocked Riga .
The dominant presence of the Swedes in the Baltic region gave the Lithuanian army the upper hand , as von Mansfeld and the Swedish army did not expect the possibility of an attack in such a heavily Swedish-occupied region .
Chodkiewicz 's army consisted of two ships obtained in Pärnu , filled with Samogitians infantry and armed with cannons brought in from Pärnu castle .
The squadron was additionally reinforced by a few hastily armed merchant ships ( probably five ) purchased from the English and Dutch , and a couple of boats and bateaux .
To assist in managing vessel traffic , Chodkiewicz hired a few sailors , mainly Livonian .
On the night of March 23 , Chodkiewicz 's army ( consisting of Samogitians , Livonians , and probably some bribed members of the Swedish infantry ) surprise-attacked the Swedish fleet .
Using the favourable winds blowing inland , Chodkiewicz sent several ( probably four ) fire ships ( their first use in the Baltic in modern times ) into the port , setting several ships on fire and pushing them in the direction of the Swedish warships anchored in formation .
Unprepared for the attack , the Swedish attempted to save their ships by cutting their anchor ropes and to flee .
Despite this , two Swedish ships were burned and soon sank .
Retreating from the port , the Swedish unit came under fire by Samogitians ships waiting at the roadstead .
Chodkiewicz 's Swedish squadron did not attempt to engage in an artillery fight and immediately escaped to the waters of the Gulf of Riga .
Samogitians units , slower than the Swedish ships , did not attempt to pursue them .
The entire Port of Salis , together with stocks of weapons , ammunition and food , fell into the hands of the Samogitians .
The victory of Pärnu and Salis had a direct impact on the further course of the war and contributed to halting the Swedish assault on Riga .
The Battle of Sudoměř was fought on 25 March 1420 , between Catholic and Hussite forces .
The Hussites were led by Břeněk of Švihov - who was killed in battle - and Jan Žižka , whose forces proved victorious .
This was the second major battle of the Hussite Wars ; the first battle , the Battle of Nekmíř , was more of a Hussite retreat than a true fight .
The Battle of Sudoměř began after Hussite forces which had taken up temporary fortifications on the plains were found by Royalist forces , who closed in for an attack .
The Hussites were greatly outnumbered 5 to 1 , and initially hoisted the white flag , but when the Royalists refused to accept their surrender the battle truly began .
though outnumbered and comparatively ill-equipped , facing heavily armoured knights , the hussites had fortified their surroundings ingeniously .
Their flank was protected by war wagons loaded with arquebusiers , and many large ponds and marshy areas surrounded the Hussite infantry - ground which the Royalist Cavalry could not hope to cross .
One thousand Knights Hospitaller from Strakonice led by Jindřich of Hradec - killed in battle - attacked war wagons placed on a slim dam , with huge casualties but no success .
After that , another thousand Royalist cavalrymen , led by Peter von Konopischt of Sternberg - killed in the Battle of Vítkov Hill later that year - rushed a weakly held side of the Hussite formation , but were mired in marshy ground .
They dismounted in order to progress , but soon found themselves mired once more .
Following this , the Hussite light infantry equipped with flails were able to easily finish the cavalrymen .
The battle ended with the advance of night and fog , during which Žižka and the Hussite forces were able to escape .
though the catholic royalists were not entirely defeated , the fact the hussites were able to inflict such heavy casualties with so few men , and then escape soundly proved to be a great victory .
Only 400 hussites - farmers and townsmen , including women and children - beat the 2,000-strong force of heavily armoured cavalry .
Hussite General , Jan Žižka , through superior knowledge of tactics and terrain , along with the highly effective deployment of ( wagon fort ) strategies , won the day .
Texxas Jam was the informal nickname of an annual summer rock concert called the Texxas World Music Festival ( 1978–1988 ) .
It was held in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl , and in Houston , at either the Astrodome or the Rice Stadium on the campus of Rice University .
The original Texxas Jam was a three-day festival held over July 4 weekend in 1978 and encompassed rock and country .
Texxas Jam was created by Louis Messina , promoter of Pace Concerts in Houston , and David Krebs , manager of the rock acts Ted Nugent and Aerosmith .
Krebs wanted to duplicate the music festival California Jam II ( held March 18 , 1978 in Ontario , California ) in Texas .
Krebs was unfamiliar with the territory , so he contacted Messina in Houston .
A book , `` Texxas Jam : 1978–1988 , '' was published in March 2011 covering all 11 Texxas Jams .
Notes : Ted Nugent joined Aerosmith on stage for a rousing rendition of `` Milk Cow Blues '' .
For comic relief , Cheech & Chong entertained the crowd between a couple of acts .
The temperature reached 104 degrees that day ( over 120 degrees on the field ) .
To protect the Cotton Bowl , they covered the surface with black tarps .
over 100,000 people were in attendance on the hottest day of the decade .
The concert had hose sprinklers around the field edge to cool people off , and they hosed the crowd down with firehoses from the stage .
First aid stations were busy .
Artists who performed at the Texxas Jam .
This was the first southern stadium rock show since ZZ Top played to 80,000 people at UT Austin on September 1 , 1974 and tore up the field .

TKO was managed by the same management as Heart at the time , which is the reason for their appearance on the bill .
KTXQ-FM Q-102 simulcast much of this concert throughout the day , with TKO , Hagar , Nazareth , and portions of Heart 's show aired live .
Van Halen 's set was not broadcast , and KTXQ had to unplug their sound equipment for Boston 's set , which they did before Heart took the stage .
As a result , only a portion of Heart 's set was aired , the sound being broadcast from microphones placed around the Cotton Bowl .

( This was the tour that essentially ended Styx . )
Notes : Leslie West joined BTO on stage to perform Mountain 's `` Mississippi Queen . ''
Notes : The live concert footage for Poison 's video `` I Wo n't Forget You '' was filmed at this performance .
The crowd seemed wild about Poison while in actuality a drunk concert goer was on top of a lighting tower ( about 30 ' up ) trampolining on the tarp roof in nothing but a pair of blue jeans .
The crowd really enjoyed him and the Dallas PD 's attempt to get him safely to the ground .
Also , Poison was joined onstage by Paul Stanley for their performance of KISS ' `` Strutter '' .
The temperature in Dallas that day reached 104 degrees Fahrenheit , prompting many in the very crowded ground area to pass out and be lifted overhead to the indoor areas of the stadium where water fountains were at .
Water from hoses was also sprayed on the concertgoers in the field .
Van Halen 's Sammy Hagar lost his voice after only a couple of songs .
He then promised to play a free show in Dallas .
The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in 1849 but the area had a rich history well before this .
though there was a long history of european presence in the area before 19th century , it was during the 19th century that the united states began to establish a firm presence in what would become minnesota .
Many of the facets of Minnesota culture that are perceived as the area 's `` early '' history in fact originated after this period .
Notably , the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known , and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura Ingalls Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century .
The Dakota Sioux , and later the Ojibwe , tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with French , British , and later American traders at Grand Portage , Mendota , and other sites .
This trade gradually declined during the early 19th century as demand for furs in Europe diminished .
The lumber industry grew rapidly , replacing furs as the key economic resource .
Grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well .
Saw mills , and later grain mills , around Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls in east-central Minnesota became magnets for development .
By the end of the era east-central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area .
This era was also as a period of cultural transition .
At the time the U.S. took possession of the region , Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups .
Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French , British , and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area .
